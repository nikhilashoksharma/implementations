Following is a description on how to install one or more datasources on Karaf:

Form the Karaf console execute:
feature:install jdbc
install -s mvn:mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.18
install -s mvn:commons-dbcp/commons-dbcp/1.4

Edit the file <ESB RUNTIME PATH>/add-ons/datasources/dataservice/datasource-mysql.xml and copy it into <ESB RUNTIME PATH>/container/deploy

Check the Karaf console and log file that the datasource has been deployed correctly.

Attached is an example datasource file.
